# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn, visualize these trends, and eventually develop predictive models to help telecom companies proactively address customer retention.

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of the dataset, understanding its structure, and performing basic statistical analysis.
- **Visualizations:** Creating insightful visualizations to highlight patterns and trends in the data, particularly focusing on churn status, churn categories, and churn reasons.
- **Predictive Modeling (Upcoming):** Developing and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn based on various features in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics) and includes information about customers such as their demographics, service usage, and whether they have churned.

## Visualizations

### 1. Customer Churn Status
A bar plot displaying the distribution of customers who have stayed, churned, or were newly acquired.

### 2. Churn Category
A bar plot showing the different categories of churn, with customers who didn't churn excluded from this visualization.

### 3. Churn Reason
A bar plot depicting the reasons for churn among customers who have left the service.

## To Do

- Perform feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn.
- Optimize models and interpret results.
- Write a detailed report summarizing findings and recommendations.
